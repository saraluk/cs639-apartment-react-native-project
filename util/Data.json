While building staff originally was great, there has been turnover and its definitely the C team now.  Gym is fantastic though.  Worst is that they entice you in with a big discount in first lease and won't negotiate when up.  Our rent with up 1k so we moved out, which is a common theme most people we knew never renewed due to increase.  At most this is a place for an expensive brief stop before you find a better option.",
